# Brand-new board? Flash MicroPython first (one time): hold BOOTSEL
# while plugging into USB, then drop this .uf2 onto the drive:
# https://github.com/acklenx/raspberrypi/raw/main/firmware/RPI_PICO2_W-20260406-v1.28.0.uf2
#
# Open viper-ide.org, connect your Pico, and run this file.
# Everything print() sends shows up in the terminal panel.

# ...and it never gets tired of saying hi
