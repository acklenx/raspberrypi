# Worm Bin Command Center

**[Open this project in Viper IDE](https://viper-ide.org/?install=github:acklenx/raspberrypi/projects/worm-bin/package.json)**: one click installs everything it needs onto a connected Pico.

The capstone: every sensor in the toolbox, and the actuators, running
off ONE Pico at the same time. Everything is optional, hot-pluggable,
and reported honestly by the truth light, the OLED, and a live web
dashboard with controls.

## The full wiring

All I2C devices share the standard bus (SDA=GP0, SCL=GP1, 3V3, GND).

| Part | Where | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| OLED | I2C `0x3C` | rotating status pages |
| BME280 "in" | I2C `0x76` | inside the bin (SDO to GND) |
| BME280 "out" | I2C `0x77` | outside the bin (SDO to 3V3) |
| ADS1115 | I2C `0x48` | ADDR to GND; adds 4 analog channels |
| Soil moisture 1 | ADS1115 A0 | capacitive v1.2, VCC 3V3 |
| Soil moisture 2 | ADS1115 A1 | second probe, other end of the bin |
| GL5528 light divider | ADS1115 A2 | LDR to 3V3, 10k to GND, junction to A2 |
| MAX9814 mic | GP27 (pin 32, ADC1) | native ADC: needs the fast 25 ms sampling |
| DS18B20 probes | GP22 (pin 29) | one wire, many probes, 4.7k pullup to 3V3 |
| VL53L0X compaction | I2C `0x29` | lid-mounted, aimed down: gap to the bedding surface (settling/compaction) |
| Big servo (MG995) | GP16 (pin 21) | own 5V supply, grounds joined, NOT VBUS |
| Small servo (SG90) | GP17 (pin 22) | power from VBUS (pin 40) |
| Relay module | GP15 (pin 20) | module VCC per its spec (most take VBUS 5V) |

Free for expansion: GP26 (ADC0), GP28 (ADC2), ADS1115 A3, and the whole
second I2C bus (I2C1).

## The truth light

POST codes: one blink per part, in the order of the `PARTS` list in
`main.py`, then one slot per DS18B20 probe (always last, so adding a
probe grows the tail of the pattern without renumbering anything).
Short blink = OK, long blink = trouble, dark = code not running.

Default slot order: 1 BME in, 2 BME out, 3 ADS1115 bank, 4 mic,
5 compaction, then the probes. Comment a part out of `PARTS` and its slot
disappears; the pattern only ever shows what you claim to have wired.

## Dashboard

Join the PicoLabN network, browse to http://192.168.4.1: live cards
for both airs, both moistures, light, sound, compaction, and every probe,
plus sliders for both servos and a relay button. JSON at `/data`,
actuator control at `/set?big=90`, `/set?small=45`, `/set?relay=1`.

## Calibration

`MOIST_DRY_V` / `MOIST_WET_V` at the top of `main.py` are in VOLTS
(the ADS1115 reads volts, not Pico counts). Watch `moist1_v` on the
dashboard with the probe dry in air, then in a cup of water up to the
marked line, and edit the two numbers.

## Power rules

- The MG995 gets its OWN 5V supply, grounds joined to the Pico. VBUS
  cannot feed a stalled MG995.
- The SG90 drinks from VBUS (pin 40), never 3V3.
- Everything else runs on 3V3.

Files needed on the board: `main.py`, `index.html`, and from `lib/`:
`picolab.py`, `ssd1306.py`, `bme280.py`, `ads1115.py`, `vl53l0x.py`.
Or use the one-click install link in the repo README.

Fresh board? Flash the [tested MicroPython build](https://github.com/acklenx/raspberrypi/raw/main/firmware/RPI_PICO2_W-20260406-v1.28.0.uf2) first: hold BOOTSEL while plugging in, drop the file on the drive that appears, done. Details in [firmware/](../../firmware).
