# DS18B20 soil temperature web demo: waterproof probe temps on the OLED,
# the terminal, and a live web dashboard.
#
# The Pico opens a Wi-Fi network named PicoLab<N>. Join it and browse
# to http://192.168.4.1 (JSON at /data).
#
# Fault tolerant: runs with the probes missing, the display missing, or
# both, and picks either up the moment it is plugged in. No restarts.
# The wire is rescanned every cycle, so newly added probes just appear.
#
# The onboard LED runs POST codes: one blink per probe, in wire order,
# then a pause. Short blink = that probe is OK, long blink = that probe
# is in trouble. With five probes, ". . . _ ." means probe 4 has a
# problem. Plug in a sixth probe mid-run and the pattern grows to six
# blinks. No blinking at all means the code is not running.
#
# Wiring: red=3V3, black=GND, yellow (data)=GP22, and a REQUIRED 4.7k
# ohm resistor from GP22 to 3V3 (the pullup). Several probes can share
# the same three wires; the demo reads them all. Bus capacity: 10-15
# probes are easy on 4.7k; a 27-probe 3x3x3 bin wants a 2.2k-3.3k
# pullup and daisy-chain wiring; past ~50, split onto a second GPIO.
#
# Probes can be LABELED and POSITIONED (x,y,z in the bin; linear works
# too, just use x). The mapping is keyed by each probe's factory-burned
# ROM serial, so it survives rewiring: put a sticky label on the wire,
# pinch the probe, and the dashboard shows which serial warms up. Saved
# in placements.json on the board (dashboard edits it, or edit it by
# hand in Viper to match the tape).
#
# On the board: main.py, index.html, lib/picolab.py, lib/ssd1306.py.
# (onewire and ds18x20 are built into MicroPython.)
