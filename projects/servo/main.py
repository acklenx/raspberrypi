# Servo web demo: move something in the real world from a web page.
#
# The Pico opens a Wi-Fi network named PicoLab<N>. Join it and browse
# to http://192.168.4.1: a dial, a slider, and three modes:
#   manual = the slider commands the servo
#   sweep  = slow automatic 0 to 180 sweep
#   auto   = "follow light": an optional photoresistor on GP28 steers
#            the servo (sensor moves the real world!)
#
# A servo gives no feedback, so this demo cannot tell if the servo is
# actually plugged in; it keeps commanding angles and the servo starts
# moving the moment it is connected. Display optional as always.
# The truth light (the onboard LED, short blink every cycle) proves the
# CODE is running; if the servo still does not move, check its wiring.
#
# Wiring, the 3 servo wires (a servo with no power CANNOT move, no matter
# what the code does -- this is the #1 reason a servo "does nothing"):
#   RED (power)   -> VBUS = physical PIN 40 (5V). NOT 3V3! Wrong pin = no
#                    movement. (VBUS is the top-RIGHT pin, USB at the top.)
#   BROWN/black   -> any GND (e.g. physical pin 38).
#   ORANGE/yellow -> the signal, GP16 = physical PIN 21.
# On boot the servo does a small self-test wiggle: if it does NOT wiggle,
# it is power/wiring (check the RED wire on pin 40), not the code.
#
# BROWN-OUTS: a servo gulps a big spike of current the instant it starts
# moving (and a lot more if it stalls). Off USB that spike can dip the 5V
# rail enough to RESET the Pico -- the screen blanks and it reboots every
# time the servo moves. Best fix: power the servo from its OWN 5V supply
# (a phone charger or battery pack), sharing ONLY the ground with the Pico
# (signal still goes to GP16). If you must run it off USB/VBUS, solder a
# fat capacitor (470-1000uF electrolytic, mind the polarity) across the
# servo's 5V and GND right at the servo to soak up the spikes.
#
# Auto mode (optional): GL5528 photoresistor from 3V3 to GP28, plus a
# 10k resistor from GP28 to GND.
# On the board: main.py, index.html, lib/picolab.py, lib/ssd1306.py.
