# Blink, level 3: blink WHILE doing other things (asyncio).
#
# The problem with time.sleep(): it freezes the whole program. A blink
# loop that sleeps cannot also read sensors, serve a webpage, or count.
# asyncio fixes that: every task takes turns during the awaits, so the
# LED never misses a beat while real work happens.
#
# This is the same trick every fault-tolerant web demo in this repo
# uses (they do it with poll() calls; asyncio is the cleaner way you
# will grow into).
#
# Project page (docs, all levels, install link): https://github.com/acklenx/raspberrypi/tree/main/projects/blink

BLINK_ON_MS = 100      # short flash...
BLINK_OFF_MS = 900     # ...once a second: the classic heartbeat
REPORT_EVERY_S = 2     # how often the "work" task reports in

# ---- no configuration below this line ----

# Things to try:
#   1. Add a third task that prints "tick" every 5 seconds. Three
#      things at once, zero extra difficulty. That is the point.
#   2. Make the heartbeat double-flash (two quick blinks per second).
#   3. Change work() to read the chip temperature like 04-webserver.
